## Class Philosophy

#### How We Roll

We are a team working towards problem-solving enlightenment. As such, the only difference between you and I is that I've made more mistakes within this domain than you! Many of you come from amazing and difficult professions, but _all_ of you will find this difficult. That's great! The more you are challenged and the longer you stay out of your comfort zone, the more you will realize that _this is how we learn_.

Some tips for getting the most out of class are:
* Use your time here wisely.
* Give the homework your all.
* Work on side projects and a blog.
* Don't get it? _Ask questions_. There are no dumb questions, and the more you ask, the more your fellow classmates will learn, as well.
* Push yourself, have no fear and trust yourself.
* Get plenty of sleep, rest and exercise.
* Help others.

#### Expectations

Expectations for the class extend to me as much as they do to you.

* Turn in assignments on time
* Work your behind off!
* Everybody love everybody
* Mobile device etiquette

#### Respect

[Code School Manifesto](http://masondesu.github.io/code-school-manifesto/)

If there's anything resembling a golden rule at The Iron Yard, it's "Don't Be An Asshole." This is deserving further explanation, though.

First and foremost: The Iron Yard is committed to creating safe environments for learning. To quote Lambda Jam's Diversity Policy, this means a safe environment for "people of any gender identity or expression, race, ethnicity, size, nationality, sexual orientation, ability level, neurotype, religion, elder status, family structure, culture, subculture, political opinion, identity, and self-identification." If at any time something or someone makes you feel uncomfortable, contact any of the instructors, the Campus Director, or any Iron Yard staff member at any campus privately and we'll help.

All of our students will come to the class with different academic and professional backgrounds; all of our students will learn at different paces. The Iron Yard is dedicated to helping everyone learn to best of their capabilities. This means "don't compare yourself with other students."

If you understand some course materials that someone else is struggling with, be mindful not to act in ways that may discourage them. (Think back to a time in your life when you were challenged by something, and remember how acutely you percieved any subtle signs of frustration or disappontment.) Instead, take it as an opportunity to sharpen your own knowledge and help them learn. If you can't ELI5 something, you don't understand it well enough.
