# Pre-Flight Checklist
Howdy! Here is a list of recommended online resources to dive in to before class begins so that we can hit the ground running.

When you have questions, email me:

## Setup

### Create a GitHub Account
GitHub is the industry's standard code host. We will store our code in its online repositories and use it for collaboration, versioning, static website hosting and much more! Some notes:
* _Please_ use your real name and make your avatar a picture of yourself (if this concerns you, then lets talk; we'll back you up with what you want to do).
* Usernames typically are first letter of your first name and then your last name. For example, I am `rpearce`. However, any variation of your name will do.

- [ ] [GitHub's Website](https://github.com)

### System
This is not a section to take lightly.
- [ ] All students need to be using a Mac of some type (Mac, MacBook, MacBook Pro, MacBook Air, etc... don't try to program using an Apple Watch)
- [ ] Your operating system should be OSX Yosemite. To check the version, click on the Apple icon on the task bar, then "About This Mac." If you're on an older version of OSX, you can upgrade for free through the App Store. The upgrade takes a while to download, and then install, and requires a restart, so you might want to do it over lunch or an evening.
- [ ] Check out our [class install script](https://gist.github.com/rpearce/0e4b8f02d7719a51e931). We're going to be running this (or aspects of this) in order to prep our Macs for the work we're going be doing on them.

### Text Editor Options
This is a program you are going to use A LOT. In order for us to create and edit code and not go crazy, neither TextEdit nor (shudder) Notepad will do--we need colors! We need smart indenting! Your text edior will be where you write and reason about your code. I will start the class using Atom so that we are on the same page, but I will eventually switch to MacVim (my preferred editor) after a few weeks.

Find one that works for/interests you, or have Atom chosen for you by our install script.
- [ ] [Atom](https://atom.io) _(recommended)_
- [ ] [Sublime](http://www.sublimetext.com)
- [ ] [TextMate](https://macromates.com/download)
- [ ] [VIM](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vim_%28text_editor%29)
  - [ ] Type `vimtutor` in to your `Terminal` application and follow that tutorial.
  - [ ] [In-browser VIM tutorial](http://www.openvim.com)
  - [ ] [MacVim & Janus VIM setup](https://github.com/carlhuda/janus) (what I use)
- [ ] [Emacs](http://emacsformacosx.com)

## Prework
I don’t believe you can really learn to program by watching a few videos and answering some questions (and if you believed that, you probably wouldn’t be coming to The Iron Yard). However, skill acquisition takes a long time, and the work below will help introduce you to some of the ideas and skills that will form the foundation of your in-person learning experience.

Ideally, you should have this work done before you come to the class on Day 1, and if you can do everything (including hard mode)--great!

Reasonably, we're going to only spend a week (or so) covering this material before jumping into JavaScript, which is the bulk of the course. It's not important to complete everything, but it will be invaluable during the first few days if you're familiar with the underpinning concepts of everything. The second time you hear something, you learn it.

### HTML & CSS
The structure and design of the Web (and many mobile apps).
- [ ] [Web Track - Codecademy](http://www.codecademy.com/tracks/web) _(required)_
- [ ] [Front End Foundations - CodeSchool](https://www.codeschool.com/courses/front-end-foundations) _(optional)_

### JavaScript
JavaScript is necessary for EVERY software job you will ever have. We are going to cover this for the majority of the course, but please get familiar with the basics so that we can dive in!
- [ ] [JavaScript Track - Codecademy](http://www.codecademy.com/tracks/javascript) _(required)_
- [ ] [JavaScript.com](http://www.javascript.com) _(recommended)_
- [ ] [JavaScript Roadtrip - CodeSchool](http://javascript-roadtrip.codeschool.com) _(recommended)_

### Command Line
The command line (or "terminal") is the gateway to your computer's internals. It's a more direct and customizable way to do things that you'd usually do through a graphical user interface.

The command line can seem imposing and scary the first few times you're interacting with it. But: the two tools we're going to use the most as front end developers are the command line and a simple text editor, so we need to get comfortable with it.
- [ ] [Learn the Command Line - Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/courses/learn-the-command-line) _(required)_
- [ ] Check out my [how-tos writeup on a number of command line basics](../how-tos/bash_basics.md) _(optional)_

### Git/GitHub
Code needs to live somewhere that isn't your computer. It needs to have a history, and you will need to collaborate with others. Required for class and the working world.
- [ ] [TryGit - CodeSchool](https://www.codeschool.com/courses/try-git) _(required)_
- [ ] [Git Real - Codeshool](https://www.codeschool.com/courses/git-real) _(optional)_
- [ ] [Git Guide](http://rogerdudler.github.io/git-guide) _(optional)_
